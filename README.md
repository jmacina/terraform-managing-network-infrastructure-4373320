Terraform has become one of the most popular infrastructure-as-code tools in the world. For engineers and admins, learning to use Terraform in tandem with particular architectural disciplines, like cloud networking, is critical for building repeatable and reliable infrastructure. In this course, instructor William Collins dives into using Terraform to manage cloud network infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Learners start by developing an understanding of the basic core principles of Terraform before progressing to hands-on exercises. Starting with simply creating a VPC, learners will progress to more advanced topics like creating subnets, looping through resources, using built-in functions, and leveraging Transit Gateway for intelligent network segmentation.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. Each branch contains the completed code for that particular video and the starting code can be found in the previous video's branch.

The **_main_** branch contains the starting code for the course and the **_03_04_** branch contains the completed code.
